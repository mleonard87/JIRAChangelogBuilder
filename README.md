Downloads are available at http://mleonard87.github.io/JIRAChangelogBuilder/releases/

Compilation
-----------

Run 'mvn install' from the base directory to generate build/jira-changelog-builder.jar. This will also automatically execute the bundled test case.

Usage
-----

From the command line:

    java -jar jira-changelog-builder.jar <JIRA_URL> <JIRA_username> <JIRA_password> <JIRA_project_name> <version> <template_list> [<flags>]
  
Where the arguments are used as follows:
  
  *  `<JIRA_URL>`: The URL of the JIRA instance (e.g. https://somecompany.atlassian.net).
  *  `<JIRA_username>`: The username used to log into JIRA.
  *  `<JIRA_password>`: The password used to log into JIRA.
  *  `<JIRA_project_name>`: The name of the project in JIRA.
  *  `<version>`: The name of the version this changelog is for.
  *  `<template_list>`: A CSV list of paths to template files. Each templated changelog is saved into a new file which can be processed at a later stage.
  *  `<flags>` (optional): One or more of the following flags:
    * `--jql "some arbitrary JQL"`: Append the given JQL to the issue filter. eg status = "Ready for Build".
    * `--object-cache-path /some/path`: The path on disk to the cache, if you do not use this, no cache will be used. Using a cache is highly recommended.
    * `--debug`: Print debug/logging information to standard out. This will also force errors to go to the standard out and exit with code 0 rather than 1.
    * `--changelog-file-name /some/path/filename`: The path on disk to the file you wish to output the file changelog to. If you do not use this, the file changelog will be written to changelog#.txt in the working directory by default (where # is the changelog file number).
    * `--changelog-description-field "field_name"`: The name of the field in JIRA you wish to use as the changelog description field. If you do not use this, it will default to the summary field.
